Exercise 7.1 ) Write a single R command that calculates sin(e^4 + $\sqrt{arccos(1/3)}$)
```{r}
sin(exp(4) + sqrt(acos(1.0/3.0)))
```


Exercise 7.2 ) What is displayed by the following R commands?  (Guess before computing this in R.) <br/>
> x = c(pi, 4/3, 7) <br/>
> round(x, 2)

```{r}
x = c(pi, 4/3, 7)
round(x, 2)
```


Exercise 7.3 ) What is displayed by the following R commands? <br/>
> x = (1:10)^2 <br/>
> diff(range(x))

```{r}
x = (1:10)^2
diff(range(x))
```


Exercise 7.4 ) What is displayed by the following R commands? <br/>
> x = 1:4 <br/>
> y = 4:1 <br/>
> pmax(x, y)

```{r}
x = 1:4
y = 4:1
pmax(x, y)
```
